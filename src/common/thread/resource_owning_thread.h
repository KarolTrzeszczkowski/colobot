/**
 * \class CResourceOwningThread
 * \brief Wrapper around SDL thread allowing passing of resources in safe manner
 *
 * This class is a workaround for passing ownership of resources in a safe
 * manner to newly created threads. It takes a pointer to a function to call
 * in new thread and a unique_ptr to resource which is to be passed to the new thread.
 *
 * This is how it works:
 *  - in main thread: create a new thread passing the resource to it,
 *  - in main thread: wait for synchronization signal that the ownership was passed,
 *  - in new thread: acquire the resource
 *  - in new thread: signal back to main thread that the resource was acquired,
 *  - in main thread: clean up and exit
 *  - in new thread: run the specified function with the acquired resource.
 *
 * It's a bit complicated, but that's the safe (thread-safe and exception-safe)
 * way of doing this.
